booktitle = {Siggraph 1977},

abstract = {

In the production of computer generated pictures of three-dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modeling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights that is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.

pages="185--197",
abstract="Although 3D texture-based volume rendering guarantees image quality almost interactively, it is difficult to maintain an interactive rate when the technique has to be exploited on large datasets. In this paper, we propose a new texture memory representation and a management policy that substitute the classical one-texel per voxel approach for a hierarchical approach. The hierarchical approach benefits nearly homogeneous regions and regions of lower interest. The proposed algorithm is based on a simple traversal of the octree representation of the volume data. Driven by a user-defined image quality, defined as a combination of data homogeneity and importance, a set of octree nodes (the cut) is selected to be rendered. The degree of accuracy applied for the representation of each one of the nodes of the cut in the texture memory is set independently according to the user-defined parameters. The variable resolution texture model obtained reduces the texture memory size and thus texture swapping, improving rendering speed.",

year="2008",
volume="24",

abstract="We present an adaptive out-of-core technique for rendering massive scalar volumes employing single-pass GPU ray casting. The method is based on the decomposition of a volumetric dataset into small cubical bricks, which are then organized into an octree structure maintained out-of-core. The octree contains the original data at the leaves, and a filtered representation of children at inner nodes. At runtime an adaptive loader, executing on the CPU, updates a view and transfer function-dependent working set of bricks maintained on GPU memory by asynchronously fetching data from the out-of-core octree representation. At each frame, a compact indexing structure, which spatially organizes the current working set into an octree hierarchy, is encoded in a small texture. This data structure is then exploited by an efficient stackless ray casting algorithm, which computes the volume rendering integral by visiting non-empty bricks in front-to-back order and adapting sampling density to brick resolution. Block visibility information is fed back to the loader to avoid refinement and data loading of occluded zones. The resulting method is able to interactively explore multi-gigavoxel datasets on a desktop PC. ",

We describe a three-dimensional human-computer interface for neurosurgical visualization. The interface is based on the two-handed physical manipulation of hand-held tools, or "props", in free space. These user interface "props" facilitate transfer of the user's skills for manipulating tools with two hands to the operation of a user interface for visualizing 3D medical images, without need for training. The interface allows neurosurgeons to explore a 3D MRI scan of a patient's brain during presurgical planning. From the surgeon's perspective, the interface is analogous to holding a miniature head in one hand which can be "sliced open" or "pointed to" using a cross-sectioning plane or a stylus tool, respectively, held in the other hand. Cross-sectioning a 3D volume, for example, simply requires the surgeon to hold a plastic plate (held in the preferred hand) up to the miniature head (held in the nonpreferred hand) to demonstrate the desired cross-section.

abstract = {We present a multiresolution technique for interactive texture-based volume visualization. This method uses an adaptive scheme that renders the volume in a region-of- interest at a high resolution and the volume further away from this region at progressively lower resolutions. We use indexed texture maps, which allow for interactive modification of the opacity transfer function. Our algorithm is based on the segmentation of texture space into an octree, where the leaves of the tree define the original data and the internal nodes define lower-resolution approximations. Rendering is done adaptively by selecting high-resolution cells close to a center of attention and low-resolution cells away from this area. We limit the artifacts introduced by this method by modifying the transfer functions in the lower-resolution data sets and utilizing spherical shells as a proxy geometry. It is possible to use this technique for viewpoint-dependent renderings.},

@article{Nyquist:1928,
    abstract = {{The most obvious method for determining the distortion of telegraph signals is to calculate the transients of the telegraph system. This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.}},

    abstract = { Large scale and structurally complex volume datasets from high-resolution 3D imaging devices or computational simulations pose a number of technical challenges for interactive visual analysis. In this paper, we present the first integration of a multiscale volume representation based on tensor approximation within a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multiresolution rendering framework. Specific contributions include (a) a hierarchical brick-tensor decomposition approach for pre-processing large volume data, (b) a GPU accelerated tensor reconstruction implementation exploiting CUDA capabilities, and (c) an effective tensor-specific quantization strategy for reducing data transfer bandwidth and out-of-core memory footprint. Our multiscale representation allows for the extraction, analysis and display of structural features at variable spatial scales, while adaptive level-of-detail rendering methods make it possible to interactively explore large datasets within a constrained memory footprint. The quality and performance of our prototype system is evaluated on large structurally complex datasets, including gigabyte-sized micro-tomographic volumes. },

abstract = "Abstract Volume rendering methods are widely used for the high-quality visualization of various 3D datasets, especially scalar field datasets (e.g., 3D images). However, when rendering datasets with ultra-high spatial resolutions, which occupy massive (out-of-core) storage space, some traditional in-core volume rendering algorithms cannot function because the large input data can hardly be handled in the main memory. Simple modifications based on disk cache I/O do not perform well because of the overheads associated with external memory access. To solve this problem, this paper describes a semi-adaptive partitioning strategy and an efficient out-of-core visualization framework with improved volume rendering algorithms. Under this new partitioning strategy, an out-of-core dataset is spatially divided into small sub-blocks of different sizes, which are organized by a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree. Each sub-block can be loaded into the fast texture memory of the graphics hardware to be rendered by our improved volume rendering algorithms. The final result is obtained by composing the projection images of all sub-blocks after traveling the \{BSP\} tree according to the viewpoint. Experimental results indicate that the new methods are effective and efficient for visualizing out-of-core 3D scalar field datasets. "

abstract="The direct numerical simulation (DNS) method with 16 steps detailed chemical kinetics was applied to a lifted turbulent jet flame with H2/N2 fuel issuing into a wide hot coflow of lean combustion products, at temperature of 1045 K and low oxygen concentrations. The chemical reactions were handled by the library function of CHEMKIN which was called by the main program in every time step. Parallel computational technology based on message passing interface method (MPI) was used in the simulation. All the cases were run by 12 CPUs on a high performance computer system. Faver-averaged DNS results were obtained by long time averaging the transient profile and compared with the experimental data. The roll-up and evolution of the vortices in jet flame were well captured. The vortices in the same rotating direction attracted each other and those in different rotating directions repulsed each other. Through complex interactions between vortices, the original symmetrical vortex structure could be converted into nonsymmetrical and more complex structures by combination, distortion and splitting of the vortices. The transient profiles of H, OH and H2O mass fraction at 5.76 ms showed the flame structure in jet flame, especially the autoignition regions clearly. The lift-off height was about 9 d--11 d, in agreement with the experimental observation. At the corner point of the flame sheet indicated by OH and H profiles, the combustion was always enhanced by the flame curvature and extended resident time. The profiles of turbulence intensities show that the flames were diffused from the original two outside flame sheets into the core. The DNS results can be considered in developing more accurate and more universal turbulence models.",

Conformal thoracic radiation therapy relies on a quantitative understanding of the position of lungs, lung tumors, and other organs during radiation delivery. Using 4D CT data sets, medical image computing and visualization methods were developed to visualize different aspects of lung and lung tumor mobility during the breathing cycle and to extract quantitative motion parameters. A non-linear registration method was applied to estimate the three-dimensional motion field and to compute 3D point trajectories. Specific visualization techniques were used to display the resulting motion field, the tumor{\textquoteright}s appearance probabilities during a breathing cycle as well as the volume covered by the moving tumor. Furthermore, trajectories of the tumor center-of-mass and organ specific landmarks were computed for the quantitative analysis of tumor and organ motion. The analysis of 4D data sets of seven patients showed that tumor mobility differs significantly between the patients depending on the individual breathing pattern and tumor location.},
